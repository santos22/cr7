Ever wonder what a professional athlete's r√©sum√© would look like? Wonder no more!

## Background
I imagine professional athletes don't go through various rounds of interviewing (e.g. sort this linked list, talk about a time when there was conflict with a team member, etc.) like the rest of us when switching teams aka jobs. Which probably means they don't keep an updated r√©sum√© on them when looking for greener pastures. But what if they did? I was curious to see what one would look like so I went ahead and created one for Cristiano Ronaldo, the best player in the world üòâ.
